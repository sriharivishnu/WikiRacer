# WikiRacer

WikiRacer is an intelligent bot that can start at one Wiki page and jump through links to arrive at a target wiki page using NLP to speed up the search. 

### Motivation
A game I played with friends was called Wiki Race. Basically, you start at a Wikipedia page such as "Banana" and try to get to a completely unrelated page, e.g. "Microsoft" just by clicking the links on each Wiki page. I created an intelligent bot that can play this game, that tries to look for links that are similar in _meaning_ to the target word using NLP and token recognition.

I challenge you to do better by hand :)
